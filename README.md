# Python3 101

These exercises are meant to be starting point of learning python3 coding using [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (where tests are already written).

## Requirements

Before you can start working with the exercises you need to install following tools to your computer

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* Text editor/IDE (e.g. VSCode, atom, notepad++, Pycharm CE)

## Getting started

Exercises are meant to be done in order:
1. 00-strings
2. 01-numbers
3. 02-lists
4. 03-files
5. 04-phonebook

In each exercise folder you will see two (2) python (.py) files.
* `test_<exercise>.py` e.g (`test_strings.py`)
* `<exercise>.py` e.g. (`strings.py`)

You're not allowed to modify `test_<exercise>.py` files in these exercises since they validate that you have implemented the features correctly.
