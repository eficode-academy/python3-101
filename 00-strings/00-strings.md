## length

Implement a function `length` that takes a string parameter. Return the length of that string

## without

Implement a function `without` that takes two parameters, `text` and `to_remove`. Remove `to_remove` from the `text` and return the result

## count_distinct

Implement a function `count_distinct` that takes a string parameter. Return a number of distinct words in the string. *Hint* `set`
